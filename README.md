# 🌩️ Cloud Infrastructure Repository - AWS & Terraform 🚀

Welcome to the **Cloud Engineer's Repository**, where we manage the **AWS Cloud Infrastructure** for our microservices-based application using **Terraform**. This repository contains all the infrastructure code, configurations, and guidelines for deploying, managing, and scaling cloud resources efficiently.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to deliver a **highly available**, **scalable**, and **secure** cloud environment for a microservices-based application. We leverage **AWS** for its robust infrastructure and **Terraform** for infrastructure as code (IaC). Key features include:
- Automatic provisioning of AWS resources.
- Seamless integration with microservices architecture.
- Scalable storage, networking, and computing solutions.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a **microservices architecture**, with each service independently deployed and managed. Here's an overview of the AWS architecture:
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes traffic across EC2 instances.
- **EC2 Instances**: Hosts the microservices.
- **Amazon RDS**: Managed database service for persistent storage.
- **Amazon S3**: Centralized storage for assets, logs, and backups.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors logs, metrics, and alerts.
- **Amazon VPC**: Securely isolates the cloud infrastructure.

## ☁️ AWS Services Used

### **1. Amazon S3**
- Used for:
  - Storing static assets (e.g., images, videos).
  - Application logs and backups.
  - Hosting static websites (if needed).
- Features enabled:
  - **Bucket Versioning**: Keeps track of object versions.
  - **Lifecycle Policies**: Automates transition and deletion of objects.
  - **Bucket Policies**: Controls access at the bucket level.
  - **S3 Encryption**: Ensures data at rest is secure using SSE-S3.

### **2. Amazon EC2**
- Hosts microservices in a distributed manner.
- Auto-scaling enabled for handling traffic spikes.

### **3. Amazon RDS**
- Provides a fully managed database solution.
- Ensures data redundancy and automated backups.

### **4. Amazon CloudWatch**
- Real-time monitoring for:
  - Resource utilization.
  - Error tracking and alarms.

### **5. AWS IAM**
- Manages access control using roles and policies.
- Enforces the principle of least privilege.

### **6. Amazon VPC**
- Provides a secure, isolated environment.
- Configured with subnets, route tables, and security groups.
